# Design Systems
Design systems are a set of reusable components, guidelines, and standards that bring consistency and efficiency to a product. Your dream tech company probably has one (unless your favourite tech company is Notion...).
Design systems from tech companies are great resources to learn best practices and common interaction design patterns from the pros. Here are some of the most commonly referenced ones.
