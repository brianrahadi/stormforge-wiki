# Defining your Project Idea

So you're deciding on what project to build for StormForge. Not trying to scare you or anything, but this is going to be the hardest part. The decisions you make during the initial stages of the project will carry on to the end of the project, so itâ€™s in your best interest to proceed with caution. 

### Gather your team to make sure youâ€™re on the same page

When deciding what kind of project youâ€™ll be building, make sure to first be honest with your teammates about your goals for the project. Is your goal to create a project just for fun and build skills along the way? Or are you aiming to develop something impressive for your resume to help you land an internship? 

### **Agree on a domain or problem space to be solving**

Everyone in your team will be committing a significant amount of time to this project, so make sure that the domain is something that you agree on. If one person really wants to make an online platform for competitive mahjong but no one else does, it's going to be difficult for the rest of the team to stay motivated to see the project through completion. Throughout this thoughtdump, the example domain I'll be going with is hackathons.

### Researching the domain and its stakeholders

Identify who is involved in the domain and investigate what problems they're affected by. For example, if your domain is hackathons, then you're looking at solving a problem for hackers, mentors, judges, or organizers. Research looks different for every project, but for upper-level design courses in SIAT, they typically involve surveys and user interviews. You can also do contextual inquiry or competitive analysis. You can scour Reddit for a subreddit specific to your domain.

If you're hoping to get an impressive design project out of StormForge, you can't skip this stage of the design process. Hiring managers looking for design interns want to see that the decisions you make are supported by data. When working on a design project, you need to justify your choices with clear reasoning and evidence. Relying on your intuition is not ideal. "Moving forward on only assumptionsÂ can be risky, as the team may end up solving a problem that doesnâ€™t really matter â€” wasting time, money, and effort." ([Discovery: Definition](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/discovery-phase/) by Maria Rosala, *Nielsen Norman Group*) 

### Based on your research, identify the problems youâ€™ll be solving

After getting a good chunk of research out of the way, narrow in and identify what your top findings were. From there, you can identify a potential problem that you can solve. For example, when identifying the problems encountered by hackathon participants, I might have discovered that hackers typically struggle with finding teammates. They might find it difficult to find teammates with complementary skills and they might not feel comfortable reaching out to potential teammates they don't know.

### Reframe design problems using the How Might We method

I typically perform the How Might We method to reframe the design problem into an actionable question to help the team stay focused on the problems that you're trying to solve. In the context of hackathon participants struggling to find teammates, some How Might We questions I can ask could be:

1. HMW support participants in finding a teammates with complementary skills?
2. HMW ensure participants feel comfortable reaching out to potential teammates they don't know?
3. HMW assist participants who are new or shy in finding welcoming teams?

It's important that the HMW questions you come up with aren't suggesting a solution, because it can be restricting during the brainstorming process. A question like "How might we create an AI platform that will match hackathon teammates together?" can be limiting when helping you find a solution. Not everything needs AI!

### Brainstorming for potential solutions

**Your HMW statements will guide you to the next stage of the design process â€“ brainstorming. Don't limit yourself early on when coming up with ideas during this stage.** If someone suggests an idea that you know isn't technically feasible, don't shoot it down. It's important to get quantity over quality, and only when everyone's written their ideas for potential solutions should you start eliminating ideas or even combining them to get to the idea you and your team will eventually pursue. 

### Evaluating the feasibility of brainstormed ideas

After brainstorming ideas, discuss which ideas align with your teamâ€™s goals and resources. For example, if a brainstormed solution is reliant on AI and none of your teammates have the time or the knowledge nor are they interested in learning AI tools to bring the solution to life, chances are itâ€™s not happening. 

Only after the brainstorming process should you be thinking about the technical feasibility of your solution. When you start with a stack in mind, I find that youâ€™re shifting the focus away from the problem, and you might end up forcing a solution where a problem doesnâ€™t even exist. Though this might not be a problem if you and your teammates agreed that your project doesnâ€™t need to be resume-worthy, and youâ€™re building for fun. This is why itâ€™s important for everyone to be clear about what their expectations are for the project â€“ to ensure smooth sailing from now until the end of the program.
