# üóÇÔ∏è Project Planning 

## Setting Goals

First, focus on setting the goals of the teams and time commitments from each members:

Goals can differ - Set the most important goal and be ready to follow-through in case your main goal is not wanted:
1. Skill Development - to learn new different skills
2. Solve real world problems - whether it will actually impact and the degree to which it solves problems.

## General Timelines

1. Define the idea
2. Define Requirements - Core Features and MVP
3. Build the project plan - set your own timeline, tech stacks, designer plans
4. Design the UI/UX
   - Low Fidelity Prototype through Pen and Paper or Digital Notes
   - Medium Fidelity Prototype through Figma
   - High Fidelity Prototype through Working website with mocked hacky features
5. Design the Architecture
   - If it is a full-stack website, the database design
6. Testing and CI/CD
7. Deploy the software
8. Gather feedbacks
9. Rinse and repeat the feedback and dev process

## Main challenges

Scoping creep:
- Focus on solving a problem really well rather than tackling too many things and not finishing it.
- Time in the program is actually not that the long after we factor our all the responsibilities we have to manage.

Manage Risks
- Plan if things are not planned.
