# Researching Your Users

Now that you're getting into the brainstorming process of your projects, its important to remember who you are designing your projects for. No application, tool, or device just falls out of a coconut tree, it exists in the context... of your USERS ðŸ¥¥ ðŸŒ´ .

To get started, try and conduct some preliminary research into the areas you are exploring, talk to your potential target demographic and understand the nature of their real problems. You are problem solvers after all! Trust me, when you understand who you are designing and developing for, your project always ends up being better.

Here are a few user research references to get you up and running with the process:
