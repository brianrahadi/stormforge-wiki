# âœ¨ Intro

Hi there, welcome to StormForge wiki! This wiki is designed to be an all-in-one stop for information and resources for StormForge Developers and Designer Guide and Resources

Before that, what is StormForge?

**StormForge** - SFU Surgeâ€™s project-building and mentorship program since 2019, designed to help you bring your ideas to life!
ðŸš€ From ideation to execution, this program provides the guidance and support you need to take your projects to the next level.

## Benefits

So, what does StormForge provides compared to just building your own side projects.

Our main core ideas are based on our core motto - Engage. Empower. Innovate. StormForge acts as the connector for everyone interested in tech to meet each other.

StormForge benefits:
1. Structure - We provide a structured environment with defined timelines, goals, and resources. You typically have access to mentors, peer support, and feedback loops that help guide your progress and keep you on track.
2. Resources - We provide access to specialized resources through events, team formation, peers, and professional mentorship - We are forming mentors now after team is formed.
3. Accountability - We provide regular check-ins, accountability, and support from mentors, team members, and SFU Surge execs.
4. Networking  - We provides networking opportunities with mentors, and peers who may offer career guidance, internship opportunities, or job leads. You might also have the chance to showcase your work at SFU Surge events.

## Team

Team has been assigned, now what?

1. Ensure to get to know everyone better! We encourage each team to have socials to better know each other.
2. Know the skillsets of everyone, so everyone can learn from each other better.

Thus, onwards to Project Planning
